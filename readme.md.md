## 📌 The Checklist

**Phase 1: Foundations & Syntax**
- [ ] Programming Fundamentals (Control Flow, Variables)
- [ ] Modular Coding (Functions, Classes, Objects)

**Phase 2: Data Structures (The Toolkit)**
- [ ] Sequential Storage (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues)
- [ ] Hierarchical Data (Binary Trees, BST, Heaps)
- [ ] Network Structures (Graphs, Adjacency Lists/Matrices)
- [ ] Essential Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

**Phase 3: Navigation & Search**
- [ ] Search Techniques (Linear Scan, Binary Search)
- [ ] Graph Exploration (BFS for Layers, DFS for Paths)
- [ ] Tree Traversal Patterns (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)

**Phase 4: Order & Sorting**
- [ ] Elementary Sorts (Insertion, Selection, Bubble)
- [ ] Divide & Conquer Sorts (Merge, Quick, Shell)
- [ ] Linear Time Sorts (Radix, Counting, TimSort)

**Phase 5: Algorithmic Logic**
- [ ] Recursive Thinking (Base Cases, Call Stack)
- [ ] Backtracking Strategies (Pruning, Path Finding)
- [ ] Dynamic Programming (Top-Down Memoization, Bottom-Up Tabulation)

**Phase 6: Optimization Strategies**
- [ ] Two-Pointer Methods (Converging, Fast & Slow)
- [ ] Sliding Window Techniques (Fixed vs. Dynamic size)
- [ ] Pre-computation (Prefix & Suffix Sums)

**Phase 7: Interview Mastery**
- [ ] Efficiency Analysis (Big O, Space-Time Tradeoffs)
- [ ] Pattern Recognition & Problem Solving
- [ ] Mock Assessments & Whiteboarding
